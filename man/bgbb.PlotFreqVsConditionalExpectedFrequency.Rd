\usage{
  bgbb.PlotFreqVsConditionalExpectedFrequency(params,
    n.star, rf.matrix, x.star, trunc = NULL,
    xlab = "Calibration period transactions",
    ylab = "Holdout period transactions", xticklab = NULL,
    title = "Conditional Expectation")
}
\arguments{
  \item{params}{BG/BB parameters - a vector with alpha,
  beta, gamma, and delta, in that order. Alpha and beta are
  unobserved parameters for the beta-Bernoulli transaction
  process. Gamma and delta are unobserved parameters for
  the beta-geometric dropout process.}

  \item{n.star}{number of transaction opportunities in the
  holdout period.}

  \item{rf.matrix}{recency-frequency matrix. It must
  contain columns for frequency ("x"), recency ("t.x"),
  number of transaction opportunities in the calibration
  period ("n.cal"), and the number of customers with this
  combination of recency, frequency and transaction
  opportunities in the calibration period ("custs"). Note
  that recency must be the time between the start of the
  calibration period and the customer's last transaction,
  not the time between the customer's last transaction and
  the end of the calibration period.}

  \item{x.star}{a vector containing the number of
  transactions made in the holdout period by the groups of
  customers with the same recency and frequency in the
  calibration period. It must be in the same order as the
  rf.matrix.}

  \item{trunc}{optional integer used to truncate the plot.
  In the plot, all calibration period frequencies above the
  truncation number will be removed. If the truncation
  number is greater than the maximum frequency, R will warn
  you and change it to the maximum frequency.}

  \item{xlab}{descriptive label for the x axis.}

  \item{ylab}{descriptive label for the y axis.}

  \item{xticklab}{vector containing a label for each tick
  mark on the x axis.}

  \item{title}{title placed on the top-center of the plot.}
}
\value{
  Holdout period transaction frequency comparison matrix
  (actual vs. expected), binned by calibration period
  frequency.
}
\description{
  Plots the actual and conditional expected number of
  transactions made by customers in the holdout period,
  binned according to calibration period frequencies. Also
  returns a matrix with this comparison and the number of
  customers in each bin.

\examples{
data(donationsSummary)

rf.matrix <- donationsSummary$rf.matrix
# donationsSummary$rf.matrix already has appropriate column names

# starting-point parameters
startingparams <- c(1, 1, 0.5, 3)
# estimated parameters
est.params <- bgbb.EstimateParameters(rf.matrix, startingparams)

# get the holdout period transactions
x.star <- donationsSummary$x.star

# number of transaction opportunities in the holdout period
n.star <- 5

# Plot holdout period transactions
bgbb.PlotFreqVsConditionalExpectedFrequency(est.params, n.star, rf.matrix, x.star, trunc=6)
