\usage{
  dc.RemoveTimeBetween(elog, day1, day2, day3, day4)
}
\arguments{
  \item{elog}{event log, which is a data frame with columns
  for customer ID ("cust"), date ("date"), and optionally
  other columns such as "sales". Each row represents an
  event, such as a transaction. The "date" column must
  consist of date objects, not character strings.}

  \item{day1}{date of beginning of first period. Must be a
  date object.}

  \item{day2}{date of end of first period. Must be a date
  object.}

  \item{day3}{date of beginning of second period. Must be a
  date object.}

  \item{day4}{date of third period. Must be a date object.}
}
\value{
  list \item{elog1}{the event log with all elog$date
  entries between day1 and day2} \item{elog2}{the event
  with all elog$date entries between day3 and day4}
  \item{elog3}{elog1 combined with elog2, with all dates
  from elog2 reduced by the time removed between elog1 and
  elog2}
}
\description{
  This function creates a new event log, with time in the
  middle removed. Used, for example, in sports with
  off-seasons.
}
\details{
  The four date parameters must be in ascending order.
