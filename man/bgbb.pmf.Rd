\usage{
  bgbb.pmf(params, n, x)
}
\arguments{
  \item{params}{BG/BB parameters - a vector with alpha,
  beta, gamma, and delta, in that order. Alpha and beta are
  unobserved parameters for the beta-Bernoulli transaction
  process. Gamma and delta are unobserved parameters for
  the beta-geometric dropout process.}

  \item{x}{number of transactions; may also be a vector.}

  \item{n}{number of transaction opportunities; may also be
  a vector.}
}
\value{
  Probability of X(n)=x, conditional on model parameters.
}
\description{
  Probability mass function for the BG/BB.
}
\details{
  P(X(n)=x | alpha, beta, gamma, delta). Returns the
  probability that a customer makes x transactions in the
  first n transaction opportunities.

  Parameters \code{t} and \code{x} may be vectors. The
  standard rules for vector operations apply - if they are
  not of the same length, the shorter vector will be
  recycled (start over at the first element) until it is as
  long as the longest vector. It is advisable to keep
  vectors to the same length and to use single values for
  parameters that are to be the same for all calculations.
  If one of these parameters has a length greater than one,
  the output will be a vector of probabilities.
}
\examples{
params <- c(1.20, 0.75, 0.66, 2.78)
# The probability that a customer made 3 transactions in the first
# 6 transaction opportunities.
bgbb.pmf(params, n=6, x=3)

# Vectors may also be used as arguments:
bgbb.pmf(params, n=6, x=0:6)
